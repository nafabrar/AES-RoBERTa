# AES-RoBERTa

In this repo I show how to use transformer models such as RoBERTa to achieve state of the art result grading essays automatically.

Previous research on automatic essay scoring  https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.bea-1.15.pdf achieved a score of 0.64 QWK Cohen's Kappa on ASAP dataset 2. Here I achieve a score of 0.73 Cohen's Kappa on the cross validation set.
